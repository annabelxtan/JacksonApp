To evaluate how environmental conditions influence health, we have developed a novel measure of the space within which individuals live and move. We will create individual life-space maps, based on a custom smartphone application that uses Global Positioning System (GPS)-based methods. By mapping the space within which individuals live and move, we can study features of the social and built environment that support health, and identify opportunities for intervention to protect disadvantaged communities.
